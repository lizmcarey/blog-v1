How much do you love Doritos? </br>

Enough to navigate to the Doritos website and realize they have a [recipes section](https://www.doritos.com/recipes) so that you can incorporate Doritos into everyday meals? 

One recipe from their website caught my eye, the [Doritos pumpkin cheeseball](https://www.doritos.com/recipes/doritos-pumpkin-cheeseball). </br> 

While I wasn't too enarmored with the listed ingredients from the original recipe, I really enjoyed the creativity. So I went ahead and adapted the indredient to map onto [the cheese ball recipe from NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018455-bits-and-pieces-party-cheese-ball)

## Ingredients 
- Salted butter (4 tablespoons/56 grams)
- Shredded cheese; choose any "flavorful" cheese e.g., sharp Cheddar (1 cup/~120 grams)
- Goat cheese (3 ounces/85 grams)
- Cream cheese (4 ounces/113 grams)
- Chopped scallions (1 tablespoon)
- Cayenne (1/4 teaspoon)
- Fish sauce (1/4 teaspoon)
- Lemon juice (1 tablespoon)
- Chopped flat leaf parsley (1 tablespoon)
- Cheese chips, e.g., Doritos (1/2 cup) 
- Stem of one bell pepper or jalapeño (optional)

## Preparation 
1. Allow butter and cheeses to come to room temperature (for easier mixing)

2. Add all ingredients into a stand mixer bowl. Use the paddle attachment and stir for ~4 minutes or until all ingredients are combined. 

3. Shape the cheese ball: Transfer the cheese mixture onto plastic wrap, then shape it into a ball.

4. Prepare the coating: Place cheese chips in a ziplock bag and crush them into small bits and pieces.

5. Coat the cheese ball: Roll the cheese ball in the crushed cheese chips until it's evenly coated with an orange layer.

6. Create pumpkin lines: Wrap the cheese ball with twine, string, or rubber bands to form pumpkin-like grooves.

7. Chill: Refrigerate for 30 minutes or until firm.

8. Add the pumpkin stem (optional): Cut the tip off a bell pepper or jalapeño (jalapeños are usually more affordable and have a perfectly sized stem). Place the stem on top of the cheese ball for a festive finish.
