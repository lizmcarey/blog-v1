A few years back, Leonard and I were visiting London, and St. JOHN Bread and Wine was easily one of our favorite restaurants. Traditional British food often gets a bad rap, but clearly, the critics haven’t eaten here.

The chef, Fergus Henderson, is known for his “nose to tail” philosophy which includes cooking with every part of the animal, including the lesser-used cuts. 

Having enjoyed our dinner at his restuarant so much, we decided to get his cookbook, Nose to Tail Eating. This pork belly recipe is one of our favorites.

It’s simple and honest with pork belly as the star of the show. There's no sticky-sweet glaze or over-the-top presentation. Just rich, flavorful meat complemented by lentils.

## Instructions
1. **Brine the pork for 10 days** 
    - Bring all the brine ingredients together in a pot, and bring to the boil so the sugar and salt melt. Decant into a container and allow to cool. When cold add your meat, and leave it in the brine for the number of days required for your recipe.


2. **Boil the belly** 
    - Place the pork belly into a pan with all the other ingredients, and cover with water. 
    - Bring to the boil, skim, and reduce to a very gentle simmer with the water barely moving for 3½ hours, until the flesh is soft and giving, but not collapsing. 
    - Remove from the water, slice, and serve with lentils and mustard.


3. **Make the lentils**
    - Cover the bottom of a largish pan with olive oil, and sweat your chopped vegetables and garlic. 
    - At the moment they are only just starting to soften, not coloring, add the lentils. 
    - Stir these for a couple of minutes in the oil and vegetables, then cover with water and nestle in the thyme and parsley bundle. - Simmer and stir occasionally—you want the lentils soft but not squidgy, so that they have reserved their lentil integrity, but are not still individual hard nuts. This should take about **40 minutes.** If they dry out add a spot more water. 
    - Season with salt and pepper 
    - Stir in your chopped parsley and a splash of extra-virgin olive oil just before serving
