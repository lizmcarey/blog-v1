  A kale salad that's perfect as a side dish or a satisfying main entree

Often times salads are served as an afterthought. 
> Here are some green leaves! Look, it's green, therefore it's healthy, so just shove it down your throat. No need to try to dress it up. 

But salads should be much more than an afterthought. When treated right, salads can be wondrously delicious. 

This recipe is from Joshuse McFadden's, Six Seasons. 

For this recipe, you want Lacinato kale (aka dino kale). Don't get the curly kale- that shit is prickly and tastes terrible when raw imo.

## Ingredients
- 1 bunch of lacinato kale (aka dino kale), pull leaves from the stem
- 1 garlic clove
- 1/4 cup of grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or Parmesan- whatever's in your fridge)
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1/4 teaspoon of dried chile flakes
- Kosher salt 
- 1/4 cup of dried bread crumbs (optional- definitely delicious to have, but don't worry if you don't have it)

## Instructions
1. **Prepare/Chiffonade the kale** 
- Stack several kale leaves on top of one another and roll them into a tight cylinder. (No need to "massage" the kale, rolling them up into cylinders will tendorize the leaves enough)
- Slice leaves crosswise into very thin ribbons (about 1/16 inch)


2. **Make the dressing** 
- Mince the garlic into a fine paste (or use a microplane) and transfer to a small bowl.
- Add the Pecorino cheese, some olive oil, lemon juice, a sprinkle of chile flakes, and salt. 
- Whisk until combined.


3. **Dress & serve the salad**
- Pour the dressing over the kale and toss thoroughly to coat. 
- Taste and adjust the seasoning with more lemon juice, salt, chile flakes, as needed
- *Optional:* Top the salad with bread crumbs for crunch
