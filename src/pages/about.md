<div>
  <img src="/assets/aboutPage/Leonard-Liz-Medoc-Marathon-public.png" class="sm:w-1/2 mx-auto" alt="Liz and Leonard at Medoc Marathon">
</div>

**version 2** 
![Liz and leoanrd Medoc](@assets/images/AboutPageImgs/Leonard-Liz-Medoc-Marathon.png)

**version 3 ** 
<div>
  <img src="/assets/aboutPage/Leonard-Liz-Medoc-Marathon-public.png" class="sm:w-3/4 mx-auto" alt="Liz and Leonard at Medoc Marathon">
</div>
