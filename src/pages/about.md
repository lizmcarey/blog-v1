Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Liz, and this website is a log of all the recipes that I, my husband Leonard, and sometimes our dog Bailey love to enjoy.

When we first started working remotely during the pandemic, cooking at home together felt like a new and exciting adventure. We were constantly trying ambitious recipes, experimenting with flavors and techniques. But as time went on, the endless grocery trips and mountains of dishes started to wear us down. We fell into cooking ruts, settling for the easiest meals that required the least cleanupâ€”some truly sad desk lunches that I won't mention here. 

We realized we needed simpler recipes with fewer rare ingredients and easier cleanup, meals that offered more "bang" for the time and effort we put into making them.

While some recipes are absolutely worth the hassle, we've learned to streamline where we can, cutting out steps that don't add much to the final dish. We prioritize meals that can be made in bulk, eaten cold, or reheated without sacrificing quality.

Hence the blog title: **Remote Loaf**â€” a collection of recipes for lazy-ish cooks who still want delicious, satisfying meals.

As recreational runners who play in local tennis leagues, we also share pre-workout meals and grab-and-go recipes that fit into an active lifestyle.

Our recipes are inspired by our local food scene in San Francisco, our family heritage (a mix of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Brazilian), and some of our favorite chefs. 

We hope you find something here to love as much as we do!
